With Analyze, a therapist can add session records and the app will graph a child's progress over time.<br/><br /> Analyze is built with React and Backbone with a Parse API backend. I used Chart.js to graph the behavioral data and Sketch to design the app. <br /><br /> Analyze was an ambitious project that I coded in two weeks to fulfill the requirements of my Front-end Engineering Course with the Iron Yard.
